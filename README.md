The Nutritionist is a Streamlit application that aids its users in computing the nutritional value and calories of certain food items from pictures. The application uses Googleâ€™s generative AI, in particular the Gemini model, effectively to ascertain the nutrition composition of food images uploaded by users.

## Key Features:
File Upload: Accepting JPG, JPEG and PNG format files, users are able to upload pictures of food items that they wish to analyze.

Nutritional Evaluation: After an image has been uploaded, the app then processes the image and responds as such by providing:

Food items that appear on the image.

The amount of calories contained in each food item.

The total quantity of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, fibers, and sugars.

The possibility of the food being healthy as well as other options if it is not.

## Tech Stack:
Streamlit: For interfacing the web application.
